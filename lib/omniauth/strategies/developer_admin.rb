    # The DeveloperAdmin strategy is for use in development only.
    # It allows us to load the admin interface without the need
    # to talk to an external auth provider.
    #
    # You need to set ADMIN_EMAILS to a list with a single email
    # address in it. When you go to log in it will show a form
    # with that email address and a default developer name. You
    # should just be able to click Sign In at that stage.
    #
    # It's set up from config/initializers/omniauth but also
    # requires a POST route in config/routes.rb
    #
